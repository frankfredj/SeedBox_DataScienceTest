# What is the aproximate probability distribution between the test group and the control group

Both variables exhibit the same probabilistic structure, namely:

* They have a certain probability of making transaction(s) after visiting the cancelation page
* Given they do perform transaction(s), they will spawn a vector {Revenue, ReBill, ChargeBack, ReFund} 

with mean vector µ, and variance-covariance matrix Σ.
